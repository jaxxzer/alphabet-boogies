<h2>Alphabet Boogies</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
It's bed time and the boogie monsters are on the prowl! Hunt them down before they chomp your toesies!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Quick reflexes are necessary to keep the boogies at bay. Don't try mashing keys or the darkness will descend! Accuracy is therefore also important.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Boogie monster swarmer.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
When you see a boogie come out of the darkness, type the key corresponding to the boogie's letter body to blow it up. Don't let any of the boogies make it all the way to your bed, or they will munch your toesies. If you type an incorrect letter, the darkness will grow closer to your bed, and your score will be penalized. Killing boogies pushes the darkness back, and increases your score.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Design a game that is relavant to a 4 year old and engaging as well as not too difficult for a 4 year old. This game can also be used as an introduction to the qwerty keyboard layout and help a child learn to type. On the phaser side of things, creating a callback to carry out actions on many keypresses in an efficient manner with minimal code was the goal, and I am happy with the solution I came up with.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Fun animations, concentration and reaction requirements, relavent story line and difficulty. Dramatic elements: Alphabet boogie monster and child characters. A premise of keeping boogie mosnters away. Challenge to keep the player interested, increasing the range of letters that appear, the rate at which they spawn or move, and reducing visibility when keys are pressed incorrectly (not yet implemented).</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
It's bed time and you have your nightlight, but the other side of the room still looks pretty dark and creepy. Is that a boogie monster you see? Is there another one? Oh no!! They're coming!!! Kill the boogie monsters before they get you!</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
As above.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Ages 4-9.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
As long as you can last. You loose when a boogie monster gets you (end game condition not yet implemented).
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Concentrate, and whatever you do, don't guess or mash keys! That will only make the game harder, if you press an incorrect key your nightlight gets dimmer, and you have less time to see the boogies before they reach your bed.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My own design. I played some typing games when I was young that had pretty much the same goal.</li>
