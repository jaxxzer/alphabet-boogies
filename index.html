<h2>Gravity KING!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Increase your mass as quickly as you can, while avoiding getting caught in the gravitational pull of masses larger than yourself. Upgrade through asteroid, moon, planet and star status. Become a black hole!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should experience excitement at the prospect of absorbing many, large masses and upgrading their own mass. This also needs to be done in a timely manner as the player looses mass at a rate proportional to their current mass.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Outer Space!
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The large asteroid is attracted to your mouse, move the asteroid around and increase your mass as quickly as you can! You can only absorb masses that are smaller than your current mass. Donâ€™t get caught in the gravitational pull of a mass larger than yourself!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The game demonstrates the ability to recycle sprites and reinitialize their properties, the ability to scroll around the world, and most importantly, the ability to apply gravitational force between many, many objects. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Objects of different types have unique properties and behaviors. Metal chunks will have higher densities. Comets will spawn with very high velocities and will emit low density particles from their trail. You may encounter astronauts or ufos that may be hostile or friendly. You might also encounter satellites or other unique space junk. Find the voyager for a unique bonus. Entering a wormhole may transport you to another area in the game, or temporarily take you to an alternate universe, where the very laws of physics are different!</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a rock in space, you need to contact other rocks smaller than yourself to increase your mass. At the same time you need to avoid other objectes whose mass is greater than yours, lest you get caught in their gravitational field and get absorbed by them! As your mass increases, your status will be upgraded, from rock to asteroid to moon to planet to star to black hole.</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
As above.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Ages 9 - 99.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Last as long as you can, there will be thresholds for how low your mass can drop, as you upgrade to moon, and planet status.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Find the center of gravity, and remain near it. Occasonally you can make a trip around the perimiter of the playable area, where heavier masses are spawned.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I came up with this myself, but there is a game called agar.io that is similar in some ways.
